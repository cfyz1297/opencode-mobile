// Decide when a live-looking event stream has actually died.

// The V2 server writes a `: heartbeat` comment every ~15s (measured), which
// keeps any read on the socket from blocking forever on a healthy connection.
// A mobile socket can still die without a FIN (Wi-Fi drop, Doze, NAT timeout):
// `connected` stays true, reader.read() never returns, and nothing schedules
// a reconnect - the UI then shows the optimistic "Working..." spinner until
// the session is reopened. Treat a long silence *during a run* as a dead
// stream; silence while idle is normal and must never trigger a reconnect.
